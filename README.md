Playmemories Home Script for Exporting Media from Sony Cameras for Linux.

This program has the barebone function to scan the root directory of a Sony camera and export MTS video files into M2TS by embedding its metadata from CPI files. 
Additionally it will export all jpgs. It does so respectful of the default folder structure that Playmemories Home uses.

Have to add a logo and proper name for the task bar.
